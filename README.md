Final Submission - OldieGoldie - Group 2

This is my Term 3 DV100 project where I learned about more advanced Jquery and javascript and how to apply it in our cruise line website. I had to design my own brand, logo and website pages and then apply Jquery and and javascript to make a functioning trips and checkout page.

## About The Project

At Harmony Voyages, I believe in the extraordinary power of harmony — not just in music but in life's journeys. Our project is a testament to this belief, a symphony of travel, music, and unforgettable experiences. I am using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS to build this easy-to-use website. I want your experience to be smooth and enjoyable when booking your trip on the website.
